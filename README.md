# Project name: Telephone directory

# Project Description: 
This is an account-based system to view, add, modify, or
delete from a telephone record based on names and the corresponding phone
numbers.

This application uses some code and is inspired by https://github.com/trentshaines/PhoneBook, to be specific, the commands implementation of this code.

In addition, I also got guidance  from this tutorial: https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/cplusplus-projects/telephone-directory-in-c-project-with-source-code/ on the implemenation of the classes.
